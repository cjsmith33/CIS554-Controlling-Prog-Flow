# CIS554-Controlling-Prog-Flow

The term straight line code in Python programming refers to writing commands and Python executing them in the order written. In other words, going from point A to point B. This is the first level of working in Python.

The next level of Python programming focuses on writing more sophisticated code in Python. In this course, Cornell University Professor Walker White shows you how to create programs that incorporate decision-making and move in different directions. Programs may follow different branches based on certain conditions, or they may repeat multiple times in a loop. Writing code like this requires an understanding of program flow and of structures that are capable of controlling that flow.

Upon completion of this course, you will have the ability to perform this level of programming in Python.

What you'll do:

Write conditional statements and expressions
Design and test functions
Write and visualize loops
Design and implement divide & conquer algorithms
